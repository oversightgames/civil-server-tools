# Linux Config
The Linux Configuration, `Civil Dedicated Server\Linux\civilServer.sh`, does not have associated server tools with it. We want to bring support for this by creating a shell script in this directory for Linux users to duplicate the foregoing directories' contents and move them to the `Civil Dedicated Server\Linux\civil` location.

This is on our to-do list, but is not a priority. If you want this feature, you are free to make a contribution and create the shell script for this repository; but if not, we will try to create this as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience!
