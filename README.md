# Getting Started
Before doing anything, ensure you have the `civilServer.exe` tool installed and up to date from Steam.

Next, `civ-server.bat` is the primary tool for running a Civil Server. Before launching, ensure you set up your server location in the batch file. This is so you can package and run the server with your custom parameters. 

Things to keep in mind:

- Port 7777 must be forwarded; The Unreal Engine Default Port.
- Set ServerConfig settings with provided .ini files.
- You can set custom server parameters in the batch file.
- Server icons disabled currently.
- Plugin Support is currently unavailable.
- PlayerData is transferred but unfunctional in this build.
